Todo
* [ ] add doxygen for documentation
* [ ] centralize all bit manipulation in utils/bits.h?
* [ ] properly handle cases where FILE* == NULL in liman.c
* [ ] change unsigned long to uint64_t or size_t where suitable

Done
* [X] improve 'CircularLinkedList' by explicitly creating append, pop, shift
and using those, instead of relying on generic 'add' and 'remove' functions
(for performance gains)
* [X] fix bug where more than one '\0' was written in the end of some .comp files
* [X] improve the implementation of Tree.c
* [X] struct names in CamelCase
* [X] var and funcnames using a mesh of pascalCase and snake_case (except for Bitmap.c)
* [X] cleanup liman.c (analyze is big, compress and decompress could be better)
* [X] provide two decompression methods (1pass and 2pass)
* [X] replace fprintf for fputc whenever possible (fprintf is unsafe according to clangtidy)
* [X] use 'getopt' instead of using argv directly
* [X] add more commandline options for huhman
* [X] run valgrind and look for leak errors
* [X] reimplement huhman
* [X] change %lu for %zu in all printfs
* [X] fix total number of bytes written by 'bitmapDump'
* [X] finish translating from portuguese to english (most parts)
* [X] update README (on how to run huhman and the compressed filesize table)
* [X] rewrite README (make texts shorter, add images to the huffmantree pdf and more)
