Todo
* [ ] finish translating from portuguese to english
* [ ] cleanup liman.c (analyze is big, compress and decompress could be better)
* [ ] change %lu for %zu in all printfs
* [ ] use 'getopt' instead of using argv directly
* [ ] add more commandline options for all 3 programs
* [ ] struct names in CamelCase
* [ ] var and funcnames using a mesh of pascalCase and snake_case (except for Bitmap.c)
* [ ] use doxygen for documentation
* [ ] create a 'help' makefile target
* [ ] improve 'CircularLinkedList' by explicitly creating append, pop, shift
and using those, instead of relying on generic 'add' and 'remove' functions
(for performance gains)
* [ ] change unsigned long to uint64_t or size_t where suitable
* [ ] centralize all bit manipulation in utils/bits.h?

Done
* [X] fix bug where more than one '\0' was written in the end of some .comp files
* [X] improve the implementation of Tree.c
